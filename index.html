      <h2>Informed Consent to be in Study: Understanding Webcam Eye-tracking</h2>
      <p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Jason Geller, Ph.D.<br>
      <strong>Type of consent:</strong> Behavioral Consent Form</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        You are being invited to take part in a research study that uses webcam-based eye-tracking 
        to investigate how people process speech and language. The purpose of this study is to 
        better understand how college-aged individuals perceive and interpret spoken language, 
        and also gain insight into webcam eye-tracking more broadly. By tracking your eye 
        movements using a webcam, we aim to gain insights into how visual attention supports 
        language comprehension and information processing.
      </p>

      <h3>Who can participate?</h3>
      <p>
        You were selected to be in the study because you expressed interest in participating in 
        cognitive psychology and neuroscience research in our laboratory, and because you meet the 
        criteria for participation. In order to participate, participants must:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be 18–36 years old</li>
        <li>Be fluent in English</li>
        <li>Be able to see visual images on a computer screen</li>
        <li>Be able to hear auditory information</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What will happen?</h3>
      <p>
        If you agree to take part in this research, you will be asked to complete a series of tasks 
        involving speech sounds, words, or sentences while we track your eye movements on screen 
        using the camera on the computer. The tasks may involve listening to speech and making 
        decisions about what you hear by pressing a button, typing a response, clicking on buttons 
        on screen, or looking at an item on screen. You will also be asked to fill out a questionnaire 
        regarding your speech, language, and hearing experience and demographic information.
      </p>

      <h3>What is the time commitment?</h3>
      <p>
        The study is estimated to take 30 minutes to complete. The entire study will be conducted in one session.
      </p>

      <h3>How will we compensate you for being part of the study?</h3>
      <p>
        If you signed up through the psychological sciences participant pool (SONA), you will receive 
        1 experimental credits upon completion.
      </p>

      <h3>What are the risks and benefits?</h3>
      <p>
        There may be no direct benefits to you, but you may feel gratified in knowing that you helped 
        further scientific research. We hope that your participation in the study will tell us more about 
        how listeners comprehend spoken language and how we can use webcams to study it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The risks of participating in this study are minimal. A possible discomfort is that you may feel 
        fatigued. If you become upset or frustrated by the experiment, we encourage you to take breaks, 
        and you can withdraw from the study at any time. There may be other risks that are unknown at 
        this time. Choosing to be in this study is voluntary. If you choose not to be in this study, it will 
        not affect your current or future relations with the University, and there is no penalty or loss of 
        benefits. You are free to quit at any time, for whatever reason.
      </p>

      <h3>What will happen with your data?</h3>
      <p>
        All identifying data will be kept confidential. The research team will not be able to ascertain or 
        have access to use and/or disclose subjects’ email addresses. The data will be stored on servers 
        used to collect the data, including Gorilla (gorilla.sc) and/or Boston College web servers. They 
        will be analyzed on password-protected computers in our lab or on secure Boston College servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        All data will include unique subject IDs generated by the recruitment site. Only individuals on an 
        approved Research Personnel List will have access to this potentially identifying information. 
        Subject IDs will be replaced with our own arbitrary numeric subject IDs before any data are shared 
        with other researchers outside of our research team. This will further remove the shared data from 
        the identifying information stored outside of our control on the recruitment site. No other identifying 
        information will be requested as part of this study. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Data that have been stripped of any identifying information may be shared with other researchers, 
        who may use these data in their own research. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The Institutional Review Board at Boston College and internal Boston College auditors may 
        review the research records. State or federal laws or court orders may also require that information 
        from research study records be released. Otherwise, the researchers will not release to others any 
        information that could indicate your identity unless you give your permission, or unless the researchers 
        become legally required to do so.
      </p>

      <h3>Who can you contact if you have more questions?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have any questions or want more information concerning this research you may contact 
          Dr. Jason Geller at <a href="mailto:gellerja@bc.edu">gellerja@bc.edu</a> or (515) 520-3464.</li>
        <li>If you have any questions about your rights as a person in this research study, you may contact: 
          Director, Office for Research Protections, Boston College at (617) 552-4778, or 
          <a href="mailto:irb@bc.edu">irb@bc.edu</a>.</li>

      <p>
        Thank you for participating. In this study, we are interested in how <b>pupil size changes</b>
        while people process language.
      </p>

      <p>
        In general, <b>pupil size tends to increase when processing is more difficult</b>.
        This effect has typically been studied in controlled laboratory settings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is to test whether we can observe these same pupil-size increases
        using <b>webcam-based measurement online</b>.
